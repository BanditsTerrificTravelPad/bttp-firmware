# Build This Travel Pad firmware

## Building

* Install Arduino
* Install [MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) if you want to use Joystick input
* Plug in your BTTP pad
* Pick Arduino Leonardo from `Tools > Board` even though it's a Pro Micro
* Pick the port from `Tools > Port` because the Arduino IDE likes to get it wrong
* Look at `config.h` and change anything that needs changing
